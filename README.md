# FNFDataAPI
A C# API for Friday Night Funkin's JSON files. With this API you can modify anything in the JSON files. Including attributes of the song, like speed, bpm, and players, and even modify notes, add notes, and remove them!

# Usage
**THIS IS A DEVELOPER TOOL** this isn't for people who don't code, so don't try to use it if you have no idea how to code in C#. Please don't make issues about "how to use????" cuz i'll just close them.


To use this you must include the [latest release's dll](https://github.com/KadeDev/FNFDataAPI/releases/latest) in your C# project.


To get an example on how this is used, please look at the [TESTS project](https://github.com/KadeDev/FNFDataAPI/blob/main/FNFDataAPI/FNFDataAPITests/Program.cs#L9) for a good example on how it works.
